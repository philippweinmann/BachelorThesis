\chapter{Fundamental issues with XAI}
\label{ch:Conclusion}

\section{Interpretability}

You have to walk a fine line between interpretability and accuracy

\subsection{How to measure how Interpretable a model is}

this is too much for a bachelor thesis. But maybe talk about it and its difficulty in a word or two.


\section{Define a few key issues of XAI}

\section{How SHAP Deals with those issues}

Here would be written how well SHAP actually works, how it can be used, how it cannot be used (even more important). How we can evaluate the results of XAI and SHAP in particular)

\subsection{Example where shap works well}
\subsection{Example where shap does not work well}
